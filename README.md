# env_setup

The purpose of this project is to synchronise all config files across my linux machines.

The python script installSymLinks.py creates symlinks to the config files in the home directory.

The config files are saved in subdirectories. They get tracked in linkConfig.py, where each configfile gets listed specifically.
